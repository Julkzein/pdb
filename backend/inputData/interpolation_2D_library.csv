TellTheClass,Teacher presents information directly to the entire class,(0.1;0.6),,,(0.4;0.2),15,,1,Class,"When learners have developed intuitions about the concepts to be learned, it is effective to give a short lecture that clearly presents what these concepts.","Sinha T. & Kapur M. (2021). When problem solving followed by instruction works: Evidence for productive failure. Review of Educational Research 91(5) 761-798.","Make 2 slides that explain <task> to <age> year old learners. Each slide should have a clear title and 3-4 key points that are age-appropriate and easy to understand."
DesirableDifficultyProblem,Students work on challenging problems that enhance long-term retention,(0.0;0.2),,,(0.05;0.3),15,,1,Indiv.,"Failing to solve the problem nonetheless prepares learners to make sense of the following lecture by activating relevant prior knowledge and highlighting knowledge gaps.","Sinha T. & Kapur M. (2021). When problem solving followed by instruction works: Evidence for productive failure. Review of Educational Research 91(5) 761-798.","Create a challenge that is different from the main goal task but requires reasoning in a similar way for <age>-year old learners and last for <duration> minutes. It is fine if they don't find the right solution but they must be able to try a few things. Make it intriguing and thought-provoking."
PracticeMemory,Individual exercises focused on memorization and recall,(0.2;0.2),(0.2;0.0),10,(0.5;0.0),30,15,2,Indiv.,"Retrieval practice strengthens memory consolidation and improves long-term retention more effectively than passive review. The testing effect shows that repeated retrieval attempts create stronger memory traces.","Roediger H.L. & Karpicke J.D. (2006). Test-enhanced learning: Taking memory tests improves long-term retention. Psychological Science 17(3) 249-255.","Create memory practice exercises for <task> that will take <duration> minutes for <age>-year old learners. Include activities like flashcards, key term matching, or fill-in-the-blank questions that reinforce memorization and recall."
PracticeApplication,Students apply learned concepts to solve practical problems,(0.2;0.4),(0.3;0.1),10,(0.5;0.12),20,15,2,Indiv.,"Application practice helps transfer knowledge to new contexts and develops procedural fluency. Students learn to recognize when and how to apply concepts to real-world situations.","Mayer R.E. (2002). Rote versus meaningful learning. Theory Into Practice 41(4) 226-232.","Make exercises for <task> for <duration> minutes for <age> learners. Focus on practical application problems where students can use what they've learned in realistic scenarios. Include 3-5 progressively challenging problems."
PracticeAnalyse,Team-based analysis activities to break down and understand concepts,(0.2;0.5),(0.3;0.2),10,(0.5;0.35),20,15,2,Team,"Collaborative analysis develops critical thinking and deeper conceptual understanding. Students learn to break down complex ideas into components and examine relationships between parts.","Chi M.T.H. (2009). Active-constructive-interactive: A conceptual framework for differentiating learning activities. Topics in Cognitive Science 1(1) 73-105.","Create a team-based analysis activity for <task> lasting <duration> minutes for <age>-year old learners. Students should work in small groups to break down concepts, identify patterns, and examine relationships. Provide a structured framework with guiding questions."
PracticeEvaluate,Collaborative evaluation of ideas solutions or arguments,(0.2;0.5),(0.25;0.15),10,(0.4;0.2),20,15,2,Team,"Evaluative thinking engages higher-order cognitive processes and metacognition. Peer discussion during evaluation exposes students to diverse perspectives and improves judgment skills.","King P.M. & Kitchener K.S. (1994). Developing reflective judgment: Understanding and promoting intellectual growth. Jossey-Bass.","Design an evaluation activity for <task> for <age>-year old learners lasting <duration> minutes. Have teams assess different solutions, approaches, or arguments using clear criteria. Include a rubric or evaluation framework to guide their critical thinking."
PracticeCreate,Students create original work demonstrating mastery,(0.2;0.6),(0.2;0.1),15,(0.5;0.2),45,30,2,Indiv.,"Creation tasks require synthesis of multiple concepts and promote deep understanding. The generative learning effect shows that producing new content enhances retention and comprehension better than consuming information.","Fiorella L. & Mayer R.E. (2016). Eight ways to promote generative learning. Educational Psychology Review 28(4) 717-741.","Create a project brief for <age>-year old learners to create something original related to <task> in <duration> minutes. This could be a diagram, poster, model, story, or presentation that demonstrates mastery. Provide clear requirements and creative freedom."
AdvancedOrganiser,Brief overview to help students organize new information,(0.0;0.0),(0.05;0.05),5,(0.07;0.05),10,5,1,Team,"This activity activates prior knowledge (long term memory) which increases the probability it can be activated later when needed (working memory). Organizers provide a conceptual scaffold for integrating new information.","Luiten J. Ames W. & Ackerson G. (1980). A meta-analysis of the effects of advance organizers on learning and retention. American Educational Research Journal 17(2) 211-218.","Create a visual organizer or concept map template for <task> suitable for <age>-year old learners. This should help them organize key concepts and see relationships before diving deeper. Keep it simple and clear for a <duration>-minute activity."
Introduction,Initial presentation introducing the lesson topic,(0.0;0.0),(0.05;0.05),5,(0.1;0.1),10,5,1,Class,"Clear introductions establish learning objectives and activate schema. They help students understand the purpose and structure of the lesson reducing cognitive load during instruction.","Sweller J. van Merriënboer J.J.G. & Paas F. (1998). Cognitive architecture and instructional design. Educational Psychology Review 10(3) 251-296.","Write an engaging <duration>-minute introduction for <age>-year old learners about <task>. Include a hook to capture attention, clear learning objectives, and an overview of what they'll discover. Make it exciting and relevant to their lives."
ExplainClass,Teacher explains concepts with class-wide discussion,(0.05;0.2),,,(0.05;0.1),10,,1,Class,"Interactive explanations with class discussion promote active engagement and allow immediate clarification of misconceptions. Dialogic teaching supports co-construction of knowledge.","Alexander R.J. (2006). Towards Dialogic Teaching: Rethinking classroom talk. Dialogos.","Create a small explanatory text about <task> for <age>-year old learners that will be used in a <duration>-minute class discussion. Include 3-4 thought-provoking questions to ask students during the explanation to encourage participation and check understanding."
