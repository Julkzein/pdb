TellTheClass,Teacher presents information directly to the entire class,(0.1;0.6),,,(0.4;0.2),15,,1,Class,"When learners have developed intuitions about the concepts to be learned, it is effective to give a short lecture that clearly presents what these concepts.","Sinha T. & Kapur M. (2021). When problem solving followed by instruction works: Evidence for productive failure. Review of Educational Research 91(5) 761-798."
DesirableDifficultyProblem,Students work on challenging problems that enhance long-term retention,(0.0;0.2),,,(0.05;0.3),15,,1,Indiv.,"Failing to solve the problem nonetheless prepares learners to make sense of the following lecture by activating relevant prior knowledge and highlighting knowledge gaps.","Sinha T. & Kapur M. (2021). When problem solving followed by instruction works: Evidence for productive failure. Review of Educational Research 91(5) 761-798."
PracticeMemory,Individual exercises focused on memorization and recall,(0.2;0.2),(0.2;0.0),10,(0.5;0.0),30,15,2,Indiv.,"Retrieval practice strengthens memory consolidation and improves long-term retention more effectively than passive review. The testing effect shows that repeated retrieval attempts create stronger memory traces.","Roediger H.L. & Karpicke J.D. (2006). Test-enhanced learning: Taking memory tests improves long-term retention. Psychological Science 17(3) 249-255."
PracticeApplication,Students apply learned concepts to solve practical problems,(0.2;0.4),(0.3;0.1),10,(0.5;0.12),20,15,2,Indiv.,"Application practice helps transfer knowledge to new contexts and develops procedural fluency. Students learn to recognize when and how to apply concepts to real-world situations.","Mayer R.E. (2002). Rote versus meaningful learning. Theory Into Practice 41(4) 226-232."
PracticeAnalyse,Team-based analysis activities to break down and understand concepts,(0.2;0.5),(0.3;0.2),10,(0.5;0.35),20,15,2,Team,"Collaborative analysis develops critical thinking and deeper conceptual understanding. Students learn to break down complex ideas into components and examine relationships between parts.","Chi M.T.H. (2009). Active-constructive-interactive: A conceptual framework for differentiating learning activities. Topics in Cognitive Science 1(1) 73-105."
PracticeEvaluate,Collaborative evaluation of ideas solutions or arguments,(0.2;0.5),(0.25;0.15),10,(0.4;0.2),20,15,2,Team,"Evaluative thinking engages higher-order cognitive processes and metacognition. Peer discussion during evaluation exposes students to diverse perspectives and improves judgment skills.","King P.M. & Kitchener K.S. (1994). Developing reflective judgment: Understanding and promoting intellectual growth. Jossey-Bass."
PracticeCreate,Students create original work demonstrating mastery,(0.2;0.6),(0.2;0.1),15,(0.5;0.2),45,30,2,Indiv.,"Creation tasks require synthesis of multiple concepts and promote deep understanding. The generative learning effect shows that producing new content enhances retention and comprehension better than consuming information.","Fiorella L. & Mayer R.E. (2016). Eight ways to promote generative learning. Educational Psychology Review 28(4) 717-741."
AdvancedOrganiser,Brief overview to help students organize new information,(0.0;0.0),(0.05;0.05),5,(0.07;0.05),10,5,1,Team,"This activity activates prior knowledge (long term memory) which increases the probability it can be activated later when needed (working memory). Organizers provide a conceptual scaffold for integrating new information.","Luiten J. Ames W. & Ackerson G. (1980). A meta-analysis of the effects of advance organizers on learning and retention. American Educational Research Journal 17(2) 211-218."
Introduction,Initial presentation introducing the lesson topic,(0.0;0.0),(0.05;0.05),5,(0.1;0.1),10,5,1,Class,"Clear introductions establish learning objectives and activate schema. They help students understand the purpose and structure of the lesson reducing cognitive load during instruction.","Sweller J. van Merriënboer J.J.G. & Paas F. (1998). Cognitive architecture and instructional design. Educational Psychology Review 10(3) 251-296."
ExplainClass,Teacher explains concepts with class-wide discussion,(0.05;0.2),,,(0.05;0.1),10,,1,Class,"Interactive explanations with class discussion promote active engagement and allow immediate clarification of misconceptions. Dialogic teaching supports co-construction of knowledge.","Alexander R.J. (2006). Towards Dialogic Teaching: Rethinking classroom talk. Dialogos."
Pecho ma copine,trop cool,(0.0;0.0),,,(1.0;1.0),15,,2,Indiv.,"Custom activity for specific pedagogical needs. Flexibility in activity design allows teachers to address unique learning contexts and student requirements.","Tomlinson C.A. (2001). How to differentiate instruction in mixed-ability classrooms.
